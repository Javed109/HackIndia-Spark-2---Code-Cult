# Medical Data Blockchain MVP

Welcome to the Medical Data Blockchain MVP repository! This project aims to create a secure and decentralized system for managing medical data, ensuring data privacy and consent. Although our current prototype is a web page, we plan to develop a fully functional MVP for Android, iOS, and web platforms to maximize usability.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you'll find:
- A web page prototype showcasing our concept.
- Smart contracts for data privacy and consent management.
- Instructions for setting up the development environment.

Our goal is to revolutionize how medical data is managed and shared, starting with a pilot program at SRM Global Hospital, KTR.
